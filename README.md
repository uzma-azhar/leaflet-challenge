# leaflet-challenge
This is my submission for my module 15 challenge. 
I imported and visualized the data by doing the following:
- Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the past 7 days based on their longitude and latitude.
- Using magnitude to determine the radius of the markers and use depth to determine the colors.
- Including popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked: magnitude, location, and depth.
- Creating a legend that provides context for the map data.
